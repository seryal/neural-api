# ResNet-20 Example
ResNets provide high classification accuracy while being parameter-efficient. Their building blocks allow very deep architectures to be built. The ResNet authors tested architectures with more than 1000 layers deep.

You can find more about ResNet architecture at:
- The [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385v1.pdf) paper.
- [CAI Identity Shortcut Connection Example](https://github.com/joaopauloschuler/neural-api/blob/master/examples/IdentityShortcutConnection/).
- [Understanding and visualizing ResNets](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-and-visualizing-resnets-442284831be8).

This folder contains 2 source code examples:
- [ResNet-20](ResNet20.lpr): closely implements the ResNet-20 architecture.
- [CaiResNet-20](CaiResNet20.lpr): implements a modified ResNet-20 that takes adantage of CAI specific layers.

There is also a [web server](server) source code example ready to be used.
